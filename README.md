# Angular_Redux_Messaging_App
Angular and clean Redux messaging app

At a high level weâ€™re going to do the following:

1. Create our Store and make it accessible to our whole app via dependency
injection
2. Subscribe to changes to the Store and display them in our components
3. When something changes (a button is pressed) we will dispatch an action to the
Store.
